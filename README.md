The input parameters are:

Frequency of the desired signal in kHz
n, the relation of the wavelength with the eletric dimensions
L, the length of the side of the quad in centimeters
P, the depth of the quad in centimeters

The outputs of the function are:

Inductance of the coil, in micro Henry
The number of loops in the coil
The total length of the wire in meters
